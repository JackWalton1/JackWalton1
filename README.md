- 🤙🏻 Hi, I’m @JackWalton1
- 🧐 I’m interested in Cyber Security, Machine Learning, Fullstack dev and hope to work on self-driving software and/or cybernetics one day!
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in networking, performance, reliability, and scalability (And LeetCode of course)
- 🎉 I’m looking to problem solve with other new grads, and am always open to learning from others who have more experience.
